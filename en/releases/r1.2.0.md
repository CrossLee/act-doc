# What's New in 1.2.0

<a id="i136"></a>
#### #136 `@With` annotation now works on specific method

Before r1.2.0 `@With` can used to introduce an interceptor to a class, e.g.

```java
public class MyInterceptor extends Controller.Util {
    @Before
    public void logRequest(H.Request req) {
        Act.LOGGER.trace("<<< req to %s", req.fullUrl());
    }
}
```

```java
@With(MyInterceptor.class)
public class MyController {
    ...
}
```

The above code says requests to any action handler in `MyController` will get logged. Now r1.2.0 `@With` can be used on specific action handler method, e.g.

```java
public class MyControllerV2 {
   @With(MyInterceptor.class)
   @GetAction("/foo")
   public void handlerNeedsAuditing() {
      ...
   }
   
   @GetAction("/bar")
   public void handlerWithoutAuditing() {
      ...
   }
}
```

The above code in `MyControllerV2` shows any GET request to `/foo` will be traced while GET request to `/bar` won't.

#### #152 Allow annotation based interceptor class to be registered as global interceptor

Previously if you want to apply an interceptor, e.g. the `MyInterceptor` as we talked above, you must use `@With` annotation to apply the interceptor to the controller class. Now in r1.2.0 we have introduced `@Global` annotation so that you can specify an interceptor class to globally apply to all controller action handlers:

```java
@Global 
public class MyInterceptor extends Controller.Util {
    @Before
    public void logRequest(H.Request req) {
        Act.LOGGER.trace("<<< req to %s", req.fullUrl());
    }
    
    @After
    public void logRequestDone(H.Request req) {
        Act.LOGGER.trace(">>> req to %s", req.fullUrl());
    }
}
```

The above code says it will log URL before and after req handling for all action handlers

Or you can use `@Global` on specific interceptor method so that only that method will be applied globally:

```java
public class MyInterceptor extends Controller.Util {
    @Global
    @Before
    public void logRequest(H.Request req) {
        Act.LOGGER.trace("<<< req to %s", req.fullUrl());
    }
    
    @After
    public void logRequestDone(H.Request req) {
        Act.LOGGER.trace(">>> req to %s", req.fullUrl());
    }
}
```

The above code says it will log URL only before req handler for all action handlers. The `@After` interceptor will not be applied automatically unless the controller class or action handler method has annotation `@With(MyInterceptor.class)`

#### #153 When @NotNull used along with @DbBind it shall return 404 if binding failed

ActFramework allows it to use `@DbBind` to bind an id value in request/URL/form variable to method parameter, e.g.

```java
@GetAction("/order/{id}/price")
public double update(@DbBind("id") Order order) {
    notFoundIfNull(order);
    return order.getPrice();
}
```

In the above you have to use `notFoundIfNull(order);` to tell ActFramework to return `404 Not Found` response if the supplied ID cannot find out the `Order`. Otherwise you will get `NullPointerException` at `return order.getPrice();` line which will in turn trigger a `500 Internal Error`. 

Now in r1.2.0 ActFramework introduced an new way to simplify the expression of the above logic:

```java
@GetAction("/order/{id}/price")
public double update(@DbBind("id") @NotNull Order order) {
    return order.getPrice();
}
```

Where `NotNull` is a standard Java validation framework provided annotation. By combining `@DbBind` and `@NotNull` you tell ActFramework to inject an `Order` find by URL variable `id` and if not found then respond back `404 Not Found`.

#### #157 SEO support on routing

It is not uncommon that website do search engine optimization on their URL, e.g. the URL [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43406011/actframework-run-error-org-osgl-exception-unexpectedexception-app-not-found](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43406011/actframework-run-error-org-osgl-exception-unexpectedexception-app-not-found) opens exactly the same page as [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43406011](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/43406011). However former URL has a meaningful appendix `actframework-run-error-org-osgl-exception-unexpectedexception-app-not-found` which makes it subject to SEO (Search Engine Optimization).

ActFramework v1.2.0 provides the capability to application by introducing an new notation to URL routing, e.g.

```java
@GetAction("/article/{id}/...")
public Article getArticle(@DbBind("id") Article article) {
    return article;
}
```

The URL path `/article/{id}/...` in above path is end with `...`, meaning all the rest path parts in the URL will be ignored when ActFramework routing the request. Thus the developer can safely put whatever needed for SEO at the end of `/article/{id}/` path.

#### #160 Make ActionContext an injectable field in Controller.Base

`Controller.Util` provides a lot of useful static methods to help with coding the application controller class, thus it is an normal pratice to have your controller class extends `Controller.Util`. Now in ActFramework r1.2.0 we have introduced an new base class named `Controller.Base`. 

The difference between `Controller.Base` and `Controller.Util` is the former class has a built in protected field `context` which will get injected the currect `ActionContext` when intialized and the sub class can enjoy this little additional convenience without declaring your own `ActionContext` field:

```java
public class MyController extends Controller.Base {
    @GetAction("/foo")
    public String foo() {
        return context.i18n("foo");
    }
}
```

**Note** you still have access to all `Controller.Util`'s static methods when you extends from `Controller.Base` because `Controller.Base` extends from `Controller.Util`.

So why don't we add `protected ActionContext context` field into `Controller.Util`? The answer is `ActionContext context` field is stateful. Thus ActFramework will always create new instance for your controller if you have `ActionContext` declared as a field. Keep `Controller.Util` stateless if very important as we want to allow user's controller class extends from it and remaining stateless at the same time.

#### #161 Add an annotation that indicate an injected field is stateless

ActFramework is intelligent it won't create new instance for the controller when it detect there are no fields declared. However in some case althrough we have declared fields but we know that field is stateless (i.e. it won't change across difference requests), e.g.

```java
public class OrderService {
    @Inject
    private Order.Dao dao;
    
    ...
}
```

The `OrderService` controller as shown above has a field `Order.Dao dao`, however the `Order.Dao` is stateless, and everytime we will inject the same instance into `OrderService` instance, in which case we actually would like to keep `OrderService` a singleton controller. In ActFramework r1.2.0 we have introduced two ways to address this issue.

First, add `@Global` to your field:

```java
public class OrderService {
    @Inject
    @Global
    private Order.Dao dao;
    
    ...
}
```

The `@Global` annotation tells ActFramework that the `dao` instance is global across all `OrderService` instances, so when ActFramework detect the field `dao` it knows the field is not stateful and won't consider it as a contributor for a stateful controller instance.

The second way is to add `@Stateless` to `Order.Dao` class. This is preferred when you have control to the class to be injected:

```java
@Entity("order")
public class Order {
   ...
   @Stateless
   public static class Dao extends EbeanDao<Order> {
      ...
   }
}
```

And now you don't need to add `@Global` to the `OrderDao dao` field in your controller to make it a singleton controller:

```java
public class OrderService {
    @Inject
    private Order.Dao dao;
    
    ...
}
```
