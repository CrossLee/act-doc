# What's New in 1.3.0

#### #128 Create a mechanism to cache the GET request result

This new feature allows application developer to enable page level cache through a simple annotation:

```java
    @GetAction
    @CacheFor
    public void home() {
    }
```

The above code will cache the home page for 1 hour (the default expiration time). Developer can also specify the expiration time. as shown below, which will cache the hgome page for 30 minutes:


```java
    @GetAction
    @CacheFor(60 * 30)
    public void home() {
    }
```

Note cache only apply for `GET` request. However in certain case, e.g. facebook redirect the traffic to app's iframe, it will use `POST` request, but really it just want to get a home page of the app. In that case, we can turn on post support:


```java
    @GetAction
    @CacheFor(supportPost = true)
    public void home() {
    }
```

#### #163 Introduce `@TemplateContext` annotation

Before `r1.3.0`, unless developer specifies the template file path in the `render` API call, ActFramework looks for template file for a given action handler by [matching package name, class name and method name](http://actframework.org/doc/templating.md#location). E.g, given the following controller code:

```java
package com.mycom.myprj;

public class MyController {
    
    @GetAction("/")
    public void home() {
    }

}
```

The template file corresponding to `home()` action handler is located at:

```
resources/rythm/com/mycom/myprj/MyController/home.html
```

This is a simple rule, easy to understand and remember. However before we have provided some nice IDE plugin support, creating and navigating the template file could be a tediuos work.

Now we have introduced `@TemplateContext` so we can do something like:

```java
package com.mycom.myprj;

@TemplateContext("/my")
public class MyController {
    
    @GetAction("/")
    public void home() {
    }

}
```

And now ActFramework will locate the template file for `home()` handler at

```
resources/rythm/my/home.html
```

Which is much easier to developer to jump between action handler and template files

#### #164 Split `@Controller` annotation into `@UrlContext` and `@Port` annotation

Since we have introduced the context for `template`, now we want to bring in a pair concept: `@UrlContext`, which specify the URL context for all action handler in a class or sub classes.

Actually we do have that concept implemented in the `act.controller.Controller` annotation, say previously you can do something like:

```java
@Controller("admin")
public class Admin {

    @GetAction
    public String home() {
    }

}
```

Now we make this concept be more explicit with the introduction of `@UrlContext` concept. Thus we can rewrite the above code as:

```java
@UrlContext("admin")
public class Admin {

    @GetAction
    public String home() {
    }

}
```

Which looks better to me because at the first glance I understand that `admin` is a URL context, and requests to `/admin` is going to be handled by `Admin.home()` action handler.

There are another thing in the `@Controller` annotation: the named port specification, example:

```java
@Controller(port = "admin")
public class Admin {

    @GetAction
    public String home() {
    }

}
```

The above code means all action handlers in `Admin` controller should be put into the routing table of port configured with name `admin`. Here is the sample configuration in the app properties:

```
namedPorts=admin:5462
```

The above configuration and the code means HTTP request sent to port `5462` can be handled by `Admin.home()` action handler.

We don't want to take the `port` specificiation into `@UrlContext` annotation. Instead we introduced another annotation: `Port` to replace it:

```java
@Port("admin")
public class Admin {

    @GetAction
    public String home() {
    }

}
```

Again the code with new annotation `@Port` looks better to me as it is simpler and more expressive.

#### #168 Make all scanner favor the setting of `@Env` annotations

There are three `Env` annotations which is used to turn on/off certain features of an application in specific runtime environment configuration. For example:

```java
@Env.Mode(PROD)
public class ModuleForProd extends Module {
    @Override
    protected void configure() {
        bind(HiService.class).to(HiServiceImpl.class);
        bind(ByeService.class).to(ByeServiceImpl.class);
    }
}
```

The above code means only when app is running in `prod` mode the dependency injector module `ModuleForProd` will be applied. 

The `#168` issue is about extends the `Env` annotation to all aspect of the application. E.g.

```java
@Env.Group("test")
public class TestController {
   ...
}
```

```java
@Env.Group(value = "test", unless = true)
public class NoTestController {
   ...
}
```

The above code means if the current runtime does not belong to group `test` then the `TestController` will be ignored and no routing will be mapped. And `NoTestController` case is exactly at the other end: only when the runtime doesnot belong to `test` group, it will effect.

#### #169 New way to specify Regex variable in route path

Previously we can specify the regex in route with the following way:

```java
    @GetAction("/int/{<[0-9]+>n}")
    public int n(int n) {
        return n;
    }
```

Now with `r1.3.0` there are two more ways of specifying regex expression in route:

```java
    @GetAction("/int/{n<[0-9]+>}")
    public int n(int n) {
        return n;
    }
```

and 

```java
    @GetAction("/int/n:[0-9]+")
    public int n(int n) {
        return n;
    }
```

#### #170 Make it easy to create global template variable

Before `r1.3.0` creating global template variable is a bit hard, you have to create a separate project and extends `ImplicitVariableProvider` plugin, compare and deploy this project and then you can get your global template variable ready for use.

Now the new version makes this a super easy task, just add `@ProvidesImplicitTemplateVariable` to the method that return the variable value, e.g.

```java
    @ProvidesImplicitTemplateVariable("foo")
    public String foo() {
        return "bar";
    }

    @ProvidesImplicitTemplateVariable("bar")
    public static int bar() {
        return 3;
    }

    @ProvidesImplicitTemplateVariable("reqUrl")
    public static String url(H.Request request) {
        return request.url();
    }
```

The above code creates three implicit global template variable named `foo`, `bar` and `reqUrl` respectively. Note the method that returns the value of `reqUrl` variable has declared a variable with type `H.Request`, this is okay as long as your method argument can be injected, i.e. has provider defined.

#### #171 Add helper javascript library that extends jQuery

This enhancement added a jquery extension library named `jquery.ext.js` which can be accessed by app via `/asset/act/js/jquery.ext.js`. This library provides the following functions:

```
$.put(url, [data], function)
$.patch(url, [data], function)
$.delete(url, [data], function)
$.postJSON(url, [data], function)
$.putJSON(url, [data], function)
$.patchJSON(url, [data], function)
$.deleteJSON(url, [data], function)
```

In addition to the above util functions, this library also redirect 278 response to an ajax request. See [this SO](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/199099/how-to-manage-a-redirect-request-after-a-jquery-ajax-call)

#### #174 Support profile specific route configuration

ï¼°reviously ActFramework load route configuration in `resources/routes.conf` file. Now we extended the route file loading process and it will further look into the following locations:

```
resources/conf/routes.conf
resources/conf/common/routes.conf
resources/conf/{profile}/routes.conf
```

where `{profile}` is the current running profile.

#### #175 Create better error message when there are error enhancing classes

Previously when we have byte code enhancement error we won't get proper error page:

Now with `r1.3.0` you have an nice error page report for this kind of error:

#### #177 Better error reporting when multiple controller action/interceptor methods have the same name

ActFramework does not allow two action handler/interceptor methods have the same name. Previously the restriction caused a lot of trouble as developer does not know what happened. Now we have provided a very clear error reporting page when that happened:

![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/216930/25550325/8d34b8e6-2cbb-11e7-9e89-24b63f1aea86.png)

#### #179 Provide an annotation to mark a field or parameter as template variable

we have introduced an new annotation `@Output` to indicate a field or method parameter needs to be put into template render arguments. For exmaple 

Old way:

```java
@UrlContext("/my")
public class MyController {
  
  @LoginUser
  private User me;
  
  @GetAction("order/{id}")
  public void order(@DbBind @NotNull Order order) {
    render(me, order); // put me and order into the render arguments
  }

}
```

New way with `@Output` annotation:

```java
@UrlContext("/my")
public class MyController {
  
  @LoginUser
  @Output
  private User me;
  
  @GetAction("order/{id}")
  public void order(@DbBind @NotNull @Output Order order) {}

}
```

#### #181 Make redirect favor Controller URL context

`r1.3.0` provides a change in `redirect` call to simplify the redirect parameter, e.g.

The old code:

```java
@Controller("/admin")
public class AdminController {

    @GetAction("login")
    public void loginForm(){}    

    @GetAction("logout")
    public void logout(H.Session session) {
        session.clear();
        redirect("/admin/login"); // have to put the full URL path
    }

    ...
}
```

The new way

```java
@UrlContext("/admin")
public class AdminController {

    @GetAction("login")
    public void loginForm(){}    

    @GetAction("logout")
    public void logout(H.Session session) {
        session.clear();
        redirect("login"); // just put the relative path to the url context `/admin` 
    }

    ...
}
```
